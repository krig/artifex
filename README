# artifex

A builder for C/C++.

Aims to replace make in simple projects.

## Build script

A basic build script looks like this:

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    from artifex import program
    @program
    def myprogram(self):
        self.source = ["main.c", "util.c"]

Make it executable, and run it.

Artifex detects dependencies and only rebuilds objects if needed. If
this is not desired, run the build script with `-r` as a parameter.

To remove all built targets and intermediary files, run the script
with `-c` as a parameter.

## TODO

* support for pkgconfig
* support for include files
